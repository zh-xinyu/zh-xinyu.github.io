                <div>Two-DOF joints, such as shoulder joints and hip joints, are important parts of animals’ limbs. However, when building bio-robots, the 2-DOF ball joints are usually replaced by two single-axis joints driven by motors, which leads to more complicated
                    and weightier robots. Twisted and coiled polymer actuator(TCA) is a kind of highly regarded soft linear artificial muscle. Our project aims to develop 2-DOF joints driven by four or more SCP muscles. </div>
                <div>
                    Results: We fabricated and characterized strong TCA made of spandex and SMA, which can be powered by joule heating. A 2-DOF robotic joint driven by SCP is investigated, where we derived dynamic model of the system and controlled the system. Lots of simulation and experimented were done. A journal paper is under review of Robotics and Automation Letters.
